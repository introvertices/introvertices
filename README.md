ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Lannie and I'm a game developer from NZ. I like to write code in C#, JS, and Python, but I'm always open to learning new tools and languages :)

I come from an arts background, so I really enjoy projects that allow me to be creative, either with graphics, animation, or how information is presented. My ultimate programming goal is to open a gallery space that showcases the beauty of code, particularly with retro vibes (screensavers, viruses, web 1.0, console apps, ANSI art) - so if this sounds like something you'd like to contribute to, feel free to contact me! I'm also happy to collaborate if you need UI, animation, or other assets for your games/apps.
